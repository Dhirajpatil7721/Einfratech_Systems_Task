# Task Manager App

This is a simple Task Manager application where users can add, edit, delete, and clear tasks. The tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, which means the data will persist even after a page reload.

## Features

- **Edit Task**: Enables users to modify an existing task.
- **Delete Task**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Clear All Tasks**: Clears all tasks from the list and `localStorage`.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks are saved in `localStorage`, ensuring persistence even after a page reload.
  
## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript and `localStorage`.
